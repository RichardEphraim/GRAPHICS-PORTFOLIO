                <p>For almost twenty years, I’ve been helping clients of all shapes and sizes create beautiful and usable things. Having started my career in print design, I learned how to design for the web and to code websites early on through professional experience and freelance work. I’ve had the opportunity to learn and collaborate with the best, at top design firms like Happy Cog, Mule Design Studio and Tangible UX, where usability and accessibility are top priority.

                    I broadened my experience working as an in-house user experience designer at Radian, as an application design consultant at a couple early stage start-ups, and as a design consultant with Facebook. In each of these positions, in addition to designing, I’ve conducted research and user testing to inform the user experience and site structure.
                    
                    In 2014, I decided to dedicate my professional time to working with my own clients. I love having the opportunity to learn about what my clients are passionate about, and to help them visualize what they’d like to portray to their audiences. From sustainable flooring to wearable technology, non-profits to venture capital, and tiny start-ups to the biggest social network on the planet, diversity is what makes my job amazing.
                    
                    Not only are my clients diverse, but their projects are, as well. As an independent designer I can take on projects of all kinds, which allows me to tap into all of the experience I’ve accrued through the years. I design brochures, menus, business cards, books, annual reports, Powerpoint and Keynote presentations, responsive websites, applications—anything my clients need. My professional partners (listed below) help me take on projects of any size.

                    Working for myself (and omitting a commute) also allows me the opportunity to dedicate more of my free time to wildlife rescue and rehabilitiation, my second passion. I volunteer at the Marine Mammal Center, working with seals and sea lions; the Peninsula Humane Society, working with small mammals, songbirds, sea birds and raptors; and California Whale Rescue, the official whale entanglement response network of Northern California, of which I’m a co-founder, the Operations Coordinator, and a responder.
