            <h1>About Me</h1>
         </div>
            <div class="text-box">
                <p>For over six years, I’ve been helping businesses and organizations bring their ideas to life through innovative and impactful design. Starting my career in graphic design, I’ve honed my skills in creating compelling visuals for print and digital platforms, including branding materials, social media content, and user-friendly websites. My journey has given me opportunities to work across diverse industries, collaborate with talented teams, and contribute to meaningful projects.

                    I’ve worked with teams at Sky Vision Media as a Graphics Designer and Department Leader, developing eye-catching designs while ensuring brand consistency. At Covenant University CITS, I gained hands-on experience as a Front-End Developer, applying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance user experiences. I also served as an IT Specialist and Social Media Manager at Reality Homes Estate, where I blended technology and marketing to deliver impactful results for online audiences.
                    
                    My versatility has allowed me to design promotional materials, build user-friendly web interfaces, manage social media campaigns, and even refine search engine optimization strategies. Whether collaborating with marketing teams or delivering high-quality visuals independently, I take pride in creating designs that communicate effectively and leave lasting impressions.
                    
                    With a BSc in Computer Science from LAUTECH and expertise in tools like Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, and Canva, I’m always excited to explore new challenges. I thrive on building relationships, solving problems creatively, and helping brands connect with their audiences through exceptional design and strategy.
